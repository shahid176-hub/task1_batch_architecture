# Contributing & Development workflow

1. Fork the repository (if contributing remotely) or create a feature branch.
2. Keep PRs small and focused.
3. Run `infra/clean_and_rebuild.sh` to test local full-stack run.
4. Update `deliverables/phase2/GITHUB_LINK.txt` with the final remote repo link for submission.
